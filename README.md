Haskell implementation for elaborating a dependently typed language.

# Rationale

This is a place for me to implement and try out new (for me) techniques for implementing
elaboration for dependent type systems.
I am also dreaming of making the implementation as accessible as possible to other people who
interested in this topic. I got this idea from the [[http:https://github.com/Gabriella439/grace][Grace]] project.

In practice this means commenting the code heavily and keeping the structure as simple as
possible, thus I encourange to browse the code.

## TODO

- [ ] Lexing
- [ ] Parsing
- [ ] Minimal dependent typechecking.
- [ ] Evaluating to normal-form
- [ ] REPL
